🌍 Dhaka Air Quality — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📘 Project Overview

This project explores the air quality patterns in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using a real-world dataset containing air pollution and weather variables.
The goal was to analyze how environmental factors (like PM2.5, PM10, humidity, wind speed, etc.) impact the Air Quality Index (AQI) across different districts, divisions, and time periods.

🧠 Objectives

1. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

2. Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA

3. Visualize trends, correlations, and seasonal variations

4. Identify key drivers of poor air quality

5. Summarize findings and actionable insights for policymakers and researchers

🧹 Steps Followed

1. Data Inspection & Cleaning

Checked missing values, duplicates, and datatypes

Converted date to datetime format

Handled outliers and inconsistencies

2. Univariate Analysis

Distribution of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, etc.)

Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed)

3. Bivariate Analysis

Correlation between AQI and major pollutants

District- and division-wise AQI variation

4. Multivariate Analysis

Heatmaps and pairplots to reveal combined relationships

Seasonal trends of AQI over time

Feature Engineering (optional)

Extracted time-based features (year, month, season)

Created pollutant ratios for deeper insights

📊 Key Visualizations

📈 Correlation Heatmap – identifies relationships between pollutants and AQI

🌫️ PM2.5 vs AQI Scatter Plot – shows how fine particulates drive air quality

🧭 Boxplots by Division & District – compares pollution across regions

⏳ AQI Trend Over Time – reveals seasonal and temporal variation

🗺️ AQI Heatmap (Division × District) – visualizes regional differences

🔍 Key Insights

1. PM2.5 and PM10 are the strongest contributors to poor air quality in Dhaka.

2. Winter months have significantly higher AQI, while Monsoon seasons show cleaner air.

3. Central urban districts consistently record higher pollution than outer areas.

4. Weather variables like low wind speed and high humidity slightly worsen AQI.
